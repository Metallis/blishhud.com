## Running Blish HUD in portable mode

Instead of specifying the `--settings` argument as described in <a href="/docs/user/launch-options">Launch Options</a> a `Settings` folder can be created directly in the Blish HUB folder (next to `Blish HUD.exe`).
If present and no `--settings` argument is provided Blish HUD will store all modules and data there instead of the default under `My Documents`.

This makes it easier to have multiple independent instances of Blish HUD and even sync them between multiple computers using your favorite cloud storage service.
